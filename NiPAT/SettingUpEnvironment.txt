The NiPAT pattern detection tool was built and tested in Windows 8 environment.

1.Install cygwin
	a. select gcc c compiler from "devel"
	b. Select "make" from "devel" during setup of cygwin

2. Use txl for 64bit machine of cygwin
	a. use home/your_username directory
	b. using cygwin "mkdir" command make a txl directory there
	c. copy the txl zip file in windows mode to there
	d. now extract the zip file using cygwin "tar" command
If everything is ok...it will run and test a txl program automatically..

3. Now copy nicad in windows mode
	a. goto "tools" folder inside nicad
	b. open the "makefile" and set machinesize=m64
	c. now using cygwin appy "make" command staying inside nicad folder
	d. replace the "txl" folder inside NiCAD with the "txl" folder provided with NiPAT. This txl folder contain the necessary grammar and rule files to run NiPAT.

4. Check setup by running: ./nicad3 (or the appropriate nicad version ./nicad5), if everything ok it will show nicad command parameters.

5. Now you're all set to run NiPAT. You can run NiPAT.exe or the source code. If you run from source code then find_patterns.py is the starting file.

* The txl folder distributed with NiPAT contains source files to run NiPAT. It's not the TXL program. The TXL program can be downloaded from https://www.txl.ca/txl-index.html.
